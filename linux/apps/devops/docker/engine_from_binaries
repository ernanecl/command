# Install Docker Engine from binaries
# Install static binaries
# 1. Download the static binary archive. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/, choose your hardware platform, and download the .tgz file relating to the version of Docker Engine you want to install.

# 2. Extract the archive using the tar utility. The dockerd and docker binaries are extracted.

 tar xzvf /path/to/<FILE>.tar.gz

# 3. Optional: Move the binaries to a directory on your executable path, such as /usr/bin/. If you skip this step, you must provide the path to the executable when you invoke docker or dockerd commands.

 sudo cp docker/* /usr/bin/

# 4. Start the Docker daemon:

 sudo dockerd &

# 5. If you need to start the daemon with additional options, modify the above command accordingly or create and edit the file /etc/docker/daemon.json to add the custom configuration options.

# 6. Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

 sudo docker run hello-world
